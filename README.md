Sprint Review and Retrospective deliverable for CS 250, including Agile reflections.

## Journal Reflection – CS 250 Module Eight

Throughout this course, I’ve learned how important it is to understand user needs and translate them into functional software. Creating user stories helped me break down those needs into specific, actionable goals. Each story gave me a clear sense of what the user expects, which made implementation more focused and meaningful.

When developing programs, I start by identifying the core problem and then build incrementally. Agile practices like sprint planning, retrospectives, and daily standups helped me stay organized and responsive to change. I plan to use these processes in future projects to stay flexible and improve continuously.

Being a good team member in software development means showing up, communicating clearly, and supporting others. It’s about listening, giving constructive feedback, and being reliable. Collaboration is key, and I’ve learned that empathy and accountability make a big difference in team success.
